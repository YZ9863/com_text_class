Dozens of U.S. Capitol rioters are hoping Donald Trump's election will give them a new lease on life with a presidential pardon. Speaking of Trump, some say the "trad wife" trend on social media helped him gain traction with women voters. And NFL teams are still overlooking special teams coaches when they choose their head coaches.
Hello, everybody!  here. Hope your weekend works out just like you drew it up (to use some football coach-speak). Let's kick things off with some highlights from USA TODAY.
But first:Shooting stars!  The Leonid meteor shower hits peak activity this weekend. 
What happens if Trump pardons Jan. 6 rioters?
Hundreds of people have been imprisoned over the past four years for their roles in the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Now, with Donald Trump about to take office as president, dozens of violent rioters are pinning their hopes on Trump’s promise to issue pardons for the attack. Such a move would energize America’s far right, experts told USA TODAY. ⏭️ 
Why it matters:
Did 'trad wives' help steer women voters to Trump?
As part of their campaign to Make America Great Again, the Republican party has promised a return to the good ol’ days of strong nuclear families. At the same time, “” or  are on the rise on TikTok and Instagram featuring married women happily tasked with cooking, cleaning, and mothering. Experts say it may help explain why more women and young people voted for Trump.  
The 4B movement:
Why don't more special teams coaches become head coaches?
It's one of the most peculiar hiring patterns in NFL history: Only twice in league history have special teams coordinators been hired as non-interim head coaches. The pattern shows a potential blind spot or bias in the hiring process among NFL teams.  .
