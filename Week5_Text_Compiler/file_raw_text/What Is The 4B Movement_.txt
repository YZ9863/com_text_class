When I first heard about the 4B Movement (also known as the Four Nos), I had no clue as to what it would be about. My best guess was that it was a protest of the current election results. I was quite surprised to find out that it was a feminist protest against men's treatment of women in society.
So, What Exactly Is The 4B Movement?
The movement was created in South Korea during the 2010s in response to the South Korean government's oppressive policies that limited women's reproductive rights and bodily autonomy. This movement did not come out of nowhere - South Korean women are subjected to extreme gender discrimination, harassment and assault. As of 2023, a South Korean government study was conducted and found that 45% of women in the workplace have heard sexist and derogatory remarks from their coworkers, and 11% of women were harassed with romantic/sexual advances from a coworker. And that's from 2023. It was much worse 14 years ago. To put it into perspective, the 2010 Human Rights Report: Republic of Korea reports that, "The Ministry of Justice stated that there were 18,985 reports of rape or sexual violence during the year, resulting in the indictment of 8,385 suspects. In 2009 there were 8,746 reports and 3,858 prosecutions."
Because of the harsh and socially normalized offenses, South Korean women became fed up and decided to create the 4B Movement around the same time as the #MeToo Movement grew prevalent in the U.S. The 4B Movement - the Four Nos - are based on the following Korean principles: Bihon (no to heterosexual marriage or to stay willingly unmarried), Bichulsan (no to childbirth), Biyeonae (no to dating) and Bisekseu (no to heterosexual sex). These feminists decided to swear off men because of the constant mistreatment and abuse that they had been subjected to.
Why Is It Relevant Now?
In the U.S., the 4B movement is understood as no dating, no marrying, no having sex and no having children with any man. The movement has started to come up in discussions of acts of protests women can engage with post-the 2024 presidential election. Women across the U.S. are outraged and have begun adopting this stance in opposition to the potential impacts a second Trump presidency could have on reproductive rights and bodily autonomy. For example, access to mifepristone, an abortion medication, may be limited under Trump's new FDA appointees. 
On social media platforms, women are taking a stand after the relentless damage radical American politics have done to abortion rights, like the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the ongoing danger of a federal abortion ban. Far-right podcasts, which often use incel (involuntary celibate) and other derogatory rhetoric, serve as radicalizing mediums. In recent years, their growing popularity has led to an increasing number of men who are upholding misogynist ideals. So, the movement is rapidly spreading across the U.S. due to similar reasons that it was popular in South Korea. 
Reminders
If you have any qualms with the election results or impending policies, tell your local legislatures, call senators or write letters. We - the American people - can still make a difference because we decide what our state allows and doesn't. There are so many people who I have spoken to about the recent election results. Many are upset and don't know what to do. Just remember, protests and movements are created because people have power, no matter where in the world they reside.
