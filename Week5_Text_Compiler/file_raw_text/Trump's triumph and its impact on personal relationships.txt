       <p class="article-body__paragraph">White men were one of the groups that voted for Trump in the recent election. These men are mostly followers of Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, Andrew Tate and similar personalities who, among other ideas, argue that men are in crisis because they have ceded their power in the face of women's economic and political growth and harangue them to reassert their masculinity.</p><p class="article-body__paragraph">There seems to be a generation of men resentful because they have fallen behind in school and the workplace according to recent statistics: only 42 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 complete a bachelor's degree. As of 2019, there are more college-educated women than men in the workforce. Despite social, cultural and even economic changes, which have put women in a better place, the dominant narrative still holds that a woman must be with a man more successful than her and that if it's the other way around, the man will feel devalued. 
Some research suggests that men are happiest when women bring in 40% of the family income. If the percentage is higher, it makes them anxious. </p><p class="article-body__paragraph">The popularity of the next president of the United States among young men is worrisome, to say the least, as someone who is anti-abortion, accused of rape and other crimes, and notorious for his open misogyny and racism. </p><p class="article-body__paragraph">Although women are increasingly successful, the belief that men have to be more successful than they are means that Generation Z still expects men to pick up the tab. These circumstances have given rise to reactions such as the tradwives phenomenon, who speak out against feminism: housewives who choose to submit, who do not value equality in the home and who prefer traditional gender roles. For men with economic power this movement represents the fantasy of the submissive wife, but for the rest it leaves them out of any chance of getting a partner. </p><p class="article-body__paragraph">Part of Trump's success among young white voters, it seems, was his appearance on forums that promote masculinity and are openly hostile to women, describing them as gold diggers, obviously hostile to feminism. Some identify themselves as incels, (involuntary celibates) who declare themselves incapable of having romantic or sexual relations with women and who advocate violence against them. </p><p class="article-body__paragraph">Donald Trump sat down with at least eight podcast hosts, all men under the age of 35, representatives of the so-called manosphere, politically associated with the alt-right and the extreme right.</p><p class="article-body__paragraph">For their part, many women have reacted to Trump's triumph with panic. Many have decided to stop dating and some take public vows of celibacy, as a way to protect themselves from misogyny and as a declaration of autonomy over their bodies. Many women express disillusionment with heterosexual marriage and take their anger out on men as if they were a homogeneous group. </p><p class="article-body__paragraph">The Supreme Court's decision in 2022 to overturn Roe v. Wade, which ended the constitutional right to abortion, is one of the arguments of radicalized women's groups that propose (like the South Korean 4B movement) not dating, marrying, having sex or having children with men. </p><p class="article-body__paragraph">The definition of masculinity that still holds that the man should be the primary provider remains almost intact despite all the changes that have occurred over the past 60 years. There is an urgent need for a non-zero-sum narrative, in which women win but men win too, at work, in love relationships and in the family. </p><p class="article-body__paragraph">You can also listen to the column here.</p><p class="article-body__custom-audio__description"><strong class="article-body__custom-audio__title">Trump's triumph and its impact on personal relationshipsTrump</strong>'s triumph and its impact on personal relationships.</p>
