       <p>There are women going on a "sex strike" because of Donald Trump's re-election. Since the result of the US presidential election, social media has been flooded with women joining the 4B movement, which advocates saying no to four things: sex, marriage, children and dating men.</p>  <p>4B was created eight years ago in South Korea and takes its name from the fact that, in the Korean language, all these items begin with the letter B.</p> <p>It has now been used by women in the United States to protest against Trump's re-election. They are refusing to have sex during an administration led by a man who has been accused of sexual abuse and has appointed conservative judges who have ended abortion rights at the federal level.</p> <p>But the idea of a "sex strike" isn't exactly new... To give you an idea, women already used the method to protest against the Peloponnesian War in the Greek comedy "Lysistrata", written and staged in 411 BC.</p>
