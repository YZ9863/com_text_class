A poster hanging at the DC Open site in Washington shows Frances Tiafoe — a competitor in the field from nearby Maryland — flanked by other men such as Andy Murray and Taylor Fritz and women such as Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula.
It is a simple visualization of a complicated change to a tournament that began Monday and has been around for men since 1969, added women via a simultaneous but lower-tier and less-promoted event in 2009 and now is taking a further step by touting itself as the first combined ATP-WTA 500 event. That is two levels below Grand Slams and one level below Masters 1000s and was accomplished by elevating the women’s portion through the lease of what had been a hard-court tourney in San Jose, Calif., played the same week.
While ostensibly that puts the men and women on equal footing in Washington — where players will try to win a trophy and prepare for the U.S.
Open, the year’s last Grand Slam — it still is not equal all the way around. Most notably: The men’s champion receives a check for $353,445; the women’s champ earns $120,150.
That’s not an anomaly. There are other stops on the pro tours that include female and male players but do not pay them evenly.
“Our main goal is to work toward equal prize money. ... Especially at the combined events, we don’t want to see a discrepancy there,” said Pegula. “Fans are coming to watch both of us, and we should be making the same.”
