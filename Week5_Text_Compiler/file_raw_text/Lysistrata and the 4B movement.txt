       <p class="c-paragraph">Aristophanes (445-385 B.C.) was the most important writer of comedies in classical Greece. He was considered a conservative character who defended the religious traditions of the time and opposed the introduction of new knowledge. He was a severe critic of both the new literary forms of tragedy introduced by Euripides and Socratic philosophy. Plato points out, in his Dialogues, that Aristophanes was one of the characters who contributed to generate the hostile atmosphere that led to the condemnation of Socrates. In his comedy The Clouds, Aristophanes depicts a certain Socrates, who wanders through the air and teaches extravagant ideas, Plato wrote.</p>                        <p class="c-paragraph">In his comedies one can see, however, with modern eyes, a critique of the role that the macho Greek society had condemned women to play, and the strength that women could have, if they put their minds to it, to change their subordinate position.</p><p class="c-paragraph">It is also true that, with those same eyes, many of the author's satirical expressions and resources could not be said in our days or would run the risk of being subject to "cancellation". </p><p class="c-paragraph">In the comedies The Assemblywomen and Lysistrata, Aristophanes narrates with hilarious humor situations in which women decide to rebel against the status quo. 
It should be remembered that at that time women did not have the right to vote or to participate in political affairs.</p><p class="c-paragraph">In The Assemblywomen, an Athenian woman named Praxagora summons the rest of the women to make a coup de rudder in the very bosom where public decisions are made: the Assembly, so that the government of the city is placed in the hands of women. </p><p class="c-paragraph">In her harangue to convince her fellow women, Praxagora eloquently states:</p>                        <p class="c-paragraph">"I suffer and feel pain at the affairs of the city entirely corrupted. I see that it always makes use of bad bosses and if it ever has a good one, it will be good for one day and harmful for ten. They change him for another and he is worse. It is a hard thing to make men who have no sense of harmony enter into judgment".</p><p class="c-paragraph">The women, determined, disguise themselves as men, with male tunics and shoes, beards and moustaches. They enter the meeting place singing songs typical of rude peasants. They spit on the ground and some lean on rustic walking sticks. Many looked like shoemakers or craftsmen. The meeting had never been so crowded, and white faces and good-looking men predominated. </p><p class="c-paragraph">When they take the floor, they make very convincing proposals that highlight the superiority of women to run the affairs of the public administration, to the disbelief and surprise of the regular attendees. The proposals are voted on and the majority, made up of women in disguise, approves them. The government of the city will henceforth be in female hands. The story continues to indicate the funny situations they face in their new mission.</p><p class="c-paragraph">The comedy Lysistrata, on the other hand, tells us about the decision of Greek women to go on an indefinite sex strike, until their husbands decide to abandon the war, commit to peace and stay with their wives for a longer period of time. The wars, which were often fought, kept men away from home for months at a time, during which time the women were left to fend for themselves. </p>                        <p class="c-paragraph">Lysistrata gathered the women not only from Athens but also from Boeotia, Sparta and other cities with whom the endless battles were fought. If we want the men to make peace, we women must strike, she told them. They were all interested, but when Lysistrata explained what it was all about, many disagreed in principle. It was not easy to convince them.</p><p class="c-paragraph">But the arguments and situations that the leaderess presented to them were irrefutable.</p><p class="c-paragraph">When our husbands or lovers return from the war discharged for a few days, said Lysistrata, we are at home, with our short tunics, very transparent, and we walk very well shaved where you will understand, we enter where our husbands are well shot and already with ardors to throw us down... but, if instead of condescending, we refuse, peace is a fact. I know it well. </p><p class="c-paragraph">Lampito, one of the women summoned, was the first to accept the challenge and then, one by one, they joined the insurrection. It is hard, very hard, Lampito said, for women to sleep alone. But what can we do, if that is necessary for the peace of all.</p><p class="c-paragraph">They toasted with wine to seal their oath and went to barricade themselves in the Acropolis, where they erected barricades and remained united. They faced attempts by authority to undermine their movement through threats and physical repression. They also had to fight against the desire and weakness of some, when their husbands implored them to stop their strike and begged them to return home. </p>                        <p class="c-paragraph">The strike lasted a few days - an eternity from the men's perspective - and, after several negotiations and jostling with the commander in charge of maintaining order in the city, and when the men throughout the county were convinced that the women's will was unbreakable and they would not give in to their demand, they hastened to sign the peace treaties.</p><p class="c-paragraph">A few years ago, in South Korea, after the murderer of a woman was not charged with a hate crime, despite evidence to the contrary, the women's movement known as 4B gained strength as a protest against what they see as stifling male oppression. In a way, this group tries to emulate the strategy of the Athenian women commanded by Lysistrata to achieve their goals. The B's refer to a Korean word meaning refusal. Its militants aim not to date men, not to marry, not to have sex and not to have children.</p><p class="c-paragraph">After Donald Trump's recent triumph, countless demonstrations on social networks indicate that this movement has spread to the United States. Its promoters point out, among other things, that men were the ones who pushed for the electoral victory of a misogynist, sexist character who has openly spoken out against women's freedom and rights.</p><p class="c-paragraph">Beyond the justified reasons that these movements may have, it is worth asking "seriously": what social impact would the sex strike have if it were to become generalized and permanent?</p><p class="c-paragraph">José Saramago wrote The Intermittences of Death, a novel about the social havoc caused by the refusal of the Grim Reaper to continue doing his work, because he had fallen in love with a cellist whose time had come. Religion, insurance companies, funeral parlors, cemeteries and many other activities went bankrupt.</p><p class="c-paragraph">Now, with the intermittences of the "little death" (petite mort, as the French call orgasm), what would be the consequences in all those businesses related to sexual activity? You readers make the list. </p><p class="c-paragraph">In this case, reversing the terms used by Marx, some historical events repeat themselves, first as comedy and then as tragedy.</p>
