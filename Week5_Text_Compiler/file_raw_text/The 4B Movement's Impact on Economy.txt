       <p dir="ltr">The 4B Movement, originated in South Korea, has garnered global attention, particularly in the United States after the election of Donald Trump. By challenging societal norms tied to marriage, motherhood, and relationships, the movement advocates for women's autonomy. However, as its influence spreads, questions about its broader economic impact-particularly on labor force participation and long-term stability are emerging.</p>  <p dir="ltr">Emerging in the mid-2010s, the 4B Movement was built around four core principles: bihon (no heterosexual marriage), bichulsan (no childbirth), biyeonae (no dating), and bisekseu (no heterosexual sexual relationships). These tenets reject the societal expectation that women's primary value lies in supporting men and sustaining the family unit. 
Instead, the movement emphasizes reclaiming personal agency, reports Al Jazeera. </p>  <p dir="ltr">For many women, traditional family roles are less appealing amid economic challenges, including financial insecurity and unstable housing. These barriers make it difficult to afford the costs of raising a family. In addition, digital sexual violence, such as the non-consensual sharing of intimate content, discourages women from pursuing relationships, explains The Guardian.</p>  <p dir="ltr">While the movement empowers women, it also contributes to declining birth rates, which can have significant economic repercussions. A reduced birth rate shrinks the future workforce, hampering productivity and slowing economic growth. According to the Economic Policy Innovation Center, fewer workers mean less output, which directly impacts a country's GDP. This also affects personal well-being, as people face product shortages or longer wait times. Furthermore, the basic principle of supply and demand shows that fewer workers can drive up wages and prices, leading to higher costs for consumers. South Korea offers a glimpse into this trend, with a record-low fertility rate of 0.78 in 2022, far below the replacement level of 2.1, according to Reuters. Such demographic shifts strain social security systems, increase healthcare costs for aging populations, and challenge economic stability.</p>  <p dir="ltr">In the United States, the movement's growth coincides with heightened gender equality concerns following former President Donald Trump's return to office. His administration's stance on reproductive rights, particularly abortion access, has amplified debates surrounding women's autonomy. Moreover, endorsement from figures in the "manosphere," including Joe Rogan and Adin Ross, has bolstered Trump's appeal among young men. However, this association often reinforces regressive views on women's roles, raising alarms among advocates for gender equality, notes The Guardian.</p>  <p>If current demographic trends persist, nearly all nations could face significant population declines by the end of the century, warns Health Data.org, as cited by MBN. To address these challenges, policymakers must implement strategies that balance individual autonomy with economic resilience. These could include offering family-friendly workplace policies, such as affordable childcare and flexible work arrangements, to support women who wish to balance careers and family life. Additionally, combating digital sexual violence and ensuring safe spaces for women remain critical to fostering societal trust and stability, stresses United Nations.</p>
