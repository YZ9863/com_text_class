THE 4B Flying Club has offered 16 scholarships for Malaysian youths to obtain private licences to fly microlight aircraft.
Mara Institute of Technology in Lendu and Institut Kemahiran Mara in Jasin, Malacca have been awarded five scholarships each respectively, for their students for 1988 Another six will be offered to youths throughout the country.
Deputy Transport Minister Datuk Mohd Ali Rustam said the scholarships come from a RM300,000 donation from corporate members during the 4B Flying Club's first annual dinner earlier this month.
''The number of scholarships can be increased if the response is good and provided that the flying club has enough funds,'' he told reporters in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
The scholarships are given to youths to promote flying as a science hobby, to disseminate flying knowledge and to develop skilful pilots, he said.
''It is the club's mission to involve more youths in flying industry,'' he said, adding that there is no restriction for other youths who can finance their own flying lessons to join the club.
Currently, the club charges RM3,000 each for students below 30 years old and RM4,500 each for those above the age mentioned, to undergo flying lessons before they can get the licences. They also have to pay RM200 upon registration and a monthly fee of RM20.
A student can obtain the microlight private licence certificate on completion of 30 flying hours.
Under the licence's requirement he can also become an instructor if he can complete a 100 flying hours.
The 4B Flying Club is located at Batu Berendam Airport in Malacca and has 109 members, with three operational microlight aircraft. The microlight aircraft costs RM60,000 each.
Earlier, Mohd Ali who is also the 4B Movement head represented the club in a signing ceremony with Malaysia Airlines which has agreed to lend one of its pilot, Kushairy Shoib, to become the 4B Flying Club's new manager for a period of two years.
Malaysia Airlines was represented by its flight operations senior vice-president Dr Mohd Don Abdullah.
