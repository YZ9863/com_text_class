The Census Bureau has revealed how the global population will change between now and 2100, with some nations losing hundreds of thousands of people and others seeing large population growth.
By 2100, the Census Bureau has predicted that the largest age group will have changed from 10-14 year-olds today to 35-39 year-olds.
The bureau also predicted that the global population will have grown from 8.1 billion to 10.9 billion. However, this population growth will not be reflected equally across nations.
Some of the nations experiencing the largest boom in population are in sub-Saharan Africa. Congo, for example, is currently experiencing 3.1 percent growth and is expected to grow from a population of 115 million today to 584 million by the end of the century.
A spokesperson from the Institute of Development Studies pointed Newsweek toward research the think tank has done on how a youth-heavy population can increase conflict, stating: "There is particularly strong evidence that points to the relationship between young age structure and conflict... Youth bulges in particular have been associated with increased risk of conflict.
"The general consensus is that, in countries that will continue to experience high rates of population growth and large youth cohorts, the potential for conflict will continue to be elevated."
The U.S. currently has a population of 336.5 million people and a growth rate of 0.47 percent, with women having an average of 1.63 children.
The rate determined for a country to maintain steady population growth without factoring in immigration is 2.1 children per person. So, while the U.S. is not expected to shrink in population by 2100 (reaching 365.6 million), the largest age group will rise from 30-34 to 60-64 due to fewer young people having children.
Canada has a high rate of migration, with 6.1 people per every 1,000, meaning that per every 1,000 people in Canada, six more people will migrate to the country. Because of this, despite having a low fertility rate of 1.44 babies per woman, the Census Bureau expects that Canada will maintain a steady population level throughout this century, provided that the country maintains its current immigration policies.
China and India both have populations today of approximately 1.4 billion people. China's one child policy, which has now been reversed, will result in the country's demographics favoring the elderly in 2100, when the largest age group will be 75-79-year-olds, it is predicted. China also currently has a negative growth rate, at minus 0.03 percent, meaning it expected to drop in population down to 662.8 million people by the end of the century.
India will also have an older population in 2100, where the largest age group is predicted to be the 65-69 range. However, India has a growth rate currently of 0.72 percent, meaning that there will still be a large-sized younger population.
India's population is predicted to peak at 1.6 billion in 2060 and fall back to 1.4 billion by 2100.
Meanwhile, despite having a fertility rate of 2.52 births per woman, Russia is expected to drop from 140 million people this year to a population of 95 million in 2100.
A paper from the Atlantic Council points to a high death rate exacerbated by the war, people fleeing Russia to escape the war and the draft plus a low immigration rate as contributing factors to this demographic decline.
South Korea is expected to look dramatically different in 2100. The country has the  after a 43 percent decline in fertility over the past 10 years, and women are having an average of 0.68 children—well below the number needed to maintain steady population growth. Because of this, the largest age group predicted for 2100 is 85-89 year-olds.
Citizens' concerns about a lack of parental leave, work-life balance, a significant gender pay gap and education expenses, as well as social movements like the —which encourages South Korean women not to have children, or any sort of relationship with men—has led to some Koreans being much less likely to want to start a family.
The nation's government has been working to address these issues, announcing policies to provide major perks and subsidies for new parents. These include creating better paid paternity leave, better housing subsidies for people with families and giving families with a baby under a year old a monthly payment of 1 million won (around $712).
