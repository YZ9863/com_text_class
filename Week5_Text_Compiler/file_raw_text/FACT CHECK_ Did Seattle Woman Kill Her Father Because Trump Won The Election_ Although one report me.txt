A post  claims that a woman murdered her father due to fury over Donald Trump's re-election.
 BREAKING: Police say that a woman overwhelmed by President Trump's reelection has killed her father with ice ax in Rainier Valley. 
 - Dapper Detective (@Dapper_Det) 
Verdict: Misleading
Although one report mentioned that the suspect was “overwhelmed with emotion” about the election, there is no evidence that the motive was at all connected to Trump's re-election.
Fact Check:
On Nov. 9,  that the South Korean 4B movement has made its mark among American women who have decided to embrace the radical feminist lifestyle in the aftermath of Trump's re-election. The outlet noted a rise in 4B prevalence in the US as women promoted the movement on social media, including its four tenets to avoid dating, marriage, sex and childbirth with men.
A post appeared on X on Nov. 11, suggesting a similarly intense response to former president Trump's  on Nov. 5. The post includes a link to a local news report and the caption, “BREAKING: Police say that a woman overwhelmed by President Trump's reelection has killed her father with ice ax in Rainier Valley.”
The  in the post does not mention the election or the president elect. Additionally, a caption on the story image suggests the headline reads, “Woman allegedly overwhelmed by election killed father with ice ax in Rainier Valley.” But the actual headline from KIRO 7 news is “Seattle woman accused of killing father with ice axe after argument about lights.”
The original Nov. 11 article from  did report that the woman, named Corey Burke, was “overwhelmed with emotion” regarding Election Day, but there is no further detail on that emotion and no indication that it was negatively related to Trump's victory. This specific claim also did not cite the police.
As  by the same user who posted the misleading claim, the Seattle Times piece did refer to court documents as having recorded that the suspect shared her belief that there was “something important” about Election Day on Nov. 5, the same day she allegedly killed her father. However, the article only uses the word “election” once and never mentions either Trump or his opponent, Kamala Harris.
Other outlets reporting on the incident, including a local

, also do not mention a connection between the murder motive and the election or any of its candidates. All reports share the same information regarding the crime itself, including that Burke killed her elderly father amid a dispute about turning off the lights in their house.

The only mention of the 2024 election was The Seattle Times article broadly referring to the suspect's “emotion” about the race and the detail that the crime was committed on Election Day, as noted by the

. The story has not been reported by mainstream media, only local affiliates and local outlets.
