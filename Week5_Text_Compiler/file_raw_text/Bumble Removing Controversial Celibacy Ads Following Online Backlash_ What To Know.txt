Key Facts
After deleting all of its old posts on Instagram, Bumble teased a rebrand on its social media platforms, whichlaunchedApril 30 by saying dating needs a  wake-up call,  and featuring historic images of women  exhaustedfrom the dating scene. 
However, pictures of some of Bumble s new billboardswent viralon social media due to their suggestion that celibacy isn t the answer to dating; the ads, which feature images of women, include messaging like  Thou shalt not give up on dating and become a nun,  and  You know full well a vow of celibacy is not the answer. 
A SundayInstagram postfrom Bumble celebrating Mother s Day was flooded with comments from users encouraging women to  stay celibate,  while others declared they will delete their Bumble accounts because the company s  main interest is not women, but the patriarchy. 
Some social media usersfeel likeBumble s new anti-celibacy campaign is  counterintuitive to its origin story,  which was a dating app  where womenset the tone,  and can find romantic relationships or new platonic friends.
One TikTok creator whoseviral videohas almost 450,000 views said Bumble is  delegitimizing our celibacy because you want males to have more access to our bodies,  captioning the video  4B 4LLLLLL,  a reference to the Korean feminist4B movement, which is the refusal of childbirth, heterosexual marriage, dating and heterosexual sexual relationships.
Bumble told Forbes Monday it included the celibacy ads  as a response to the frustrations of dating,  but it s in the process of removing the ads due to the concerns it s received from customers.
In anupdated statementposted on Instagram Monday night, Bumble said it will make donations to several organizations like the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and offer the remainder of their billboard time so these groups can display their own ads.

Crucial Quote
 We have heard the concerns shared about the ad s language and understand that rather than highlighting a current sentiment towards dating, it may have had a negative impact on some of our community,  Bumble told Forbes.  This was not our intention and we are in the process of removing it from our marketing campaign, and will continue to listen to the feedback from our members."
Key Background
Bumble was released in December 2014, and received over 100,000 downloads within its first month, according to Forbes reporting. It set itself apart from other dating apps because it relied on women making the first move and sending the first message after a match. The point of this was to  feel more polite and walled-off  than other dating apps like Tinder which is infamously known for itshookup culture. However, as a part of Bumble s rebrand, the company launched the  Opening Moves  feature in April, which lets women put questions on their dating profiles, allowing men to send the first message after a match. Whitney Wolfe Herd Bumble s co-founder andformer CEO toldThe New York Times the new feature was introduced after receiving feedback from women who felt like sending the first message was a burden.
Tangent
The rise of celibacy among women has grown in recent years. Though it s popular among religious groups, many young women havesaidthey re not celibate because of religion, but instead to reevaluate their relationships with men. Actress Julia Fox even weighed in on the celibacy conversation,commenting 2.5 years of celibacy and never better tbh  on a viral TikTok video that featured pictures of Bumble s celibacy ads.
Big Number
4 million. That s how many paying users Bumble had in 2023, according to a Februaryannouncement. Its app revenue increased by 22% to $884.8 million last year.
