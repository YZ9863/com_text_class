       <p class="">Among the various calamities that squeeze my heart these days is the unmitigated horror of the dana (and the disgusting sectarian manipulation that followed: we are so blind that not even the greatest tragedy is able to unite us), or the apocalyptic dystopia that is the triumph of Monster Trump (not Mister). But today I am going to talk about another subject that is also very sad and astonishing: the incomprehensible abusive attitude against women shown by so many men, evidenced for the umpteenth time (and unfortunately it will not be the last) with the Errejón case.</p><p class="">But, for heaven's sake, what the hell is wrong with men, what part of the intricate machinery of their brain or heart is broken? This agonizing and astonished question is the one that goes to your head, right off the bat, every time such a case comes to public light. Errejón! One of the colleagues of the anti-sexist path!
 You too! There are times when it seems that it rains and it never pours.</p><p class="">Simone de Beauvoir used to say that machismo was not a problem of women, but a problem of men with women, and she was absolutely right. I would like to be able to explain to my colleagues on the planet that, in cases like this, the first thing we feel, or at least it happens to me, is not anger or enmity or desire for revenge, but dismay and bewilderment. But how is it possible, is it that everyone has a little monster inside them that can break out at any moment? Perhaps testosterone is too unstable, even toxic, and, boosted by the aberration of a macho upbringing, can lead to pathology. Anyway, there is surely some of this, but to these extremes? I refuse to accept it. This is not the world we want.</p><p class="">It is not the world we want, but it exists. A most violent hatred pursues the women of the Earth. Their clitoris is cut off; they are raped as spoils of war. They are married off as children by force. They are beaten to death for not wearing the veil. In Afghanistan, women's voices have just been banned from being heard in public. They are buried alive, silenced. And the international community remains unperturbed by these atrocities.</p><p class="">No wonder that in some communities particularly crushed by sexism, women are resorting to extreme measures, such as the 4B movement in South Korea, an economically modern yet highly sexist country. The 4B movement started in 2019 and comes from four mandates that its followers practice: bihon (no marriage), bichulsan (no childbirth), biyeonae (no dating with men) and bikesu (no sex with men). And the most interesting thing is that this radical initiative is sweeping the world like a fire on dry stubble. If men don't change, many women seem to be saying, we will live apart from them. All this is not new; back in the fierce 19th century numerous women chose to live together without men in what were called "Boston marriages" (a term born out of Henry James' novel The Bostonians). Although sometimes there could be a lesbian ingredient, what most sought was autonomy and a full life without men. Not to mention those women who have gone on sex strike to force men to end wars or injustices, as in Lysistrata, the famous comedy by the Greek Aristophanes, or as in several current historical examples: in the Liberian war of 2003, in Turkey in 2009, in Ukraine in 2010, in the Philippines in 2012, in Kenya in 2009 and 2017... It seems that women are, we are, increasingly fed up with putting up with the unbearable.</p><p class="">I don't want to live without them. Without the men. What I want is to live without male chauvinist barbarism. When I feel sad, as with the Errejón case, I think of the many wonderful men I have had in my life. Lovers with whom I have laughed and grown and learned a lot; from youth, Roberto and David, to maturity, Javier, John, Pablo. And friends, essential brothers: Alejandro, Fernando, Gorka, Carlos and fortunately so many others that I can't fit here. Thank you very much, my men of light, because you are the consolation in the face of the disconsolation of sexism. The undeniable hope. But yes: to you, my dear ones, and to the other white-hearted men that exist in the world, I remind you that machismo is your problem. Let's see what you can do about it.</p>
