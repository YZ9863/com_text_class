       <p>South Korean feminist movement 4B went viral after the US election. The proposal rejects marriage, children, sexual relationships and dating men in order to combat misogyny.Christine Ivans says it was difficult when she began to withdraw from relationships with men at the age of 30. The decision came from a reassessment of her priorities: to invest all her energy in herself instead of trying to find the "ideal man".</p> <p>A few months passed. Then a few years. "I'm happy. I got a promotion, a raise and my mental health has improved," says Ivans eight years later.</p> <p>But it wasn't until she discovered the 4B movement (which stands for "four no's") on TikTok that she realized she wasn't alone. 
"The four no's are: no marriage, no children, no dating or sexual relationships with men - all of which I've been practicing for some time," she explains.</p> <p>The 4B movement, which emerged in South Korea in the mid-2010s, has gradually become popular among the American public.</p> <p>Earlier this year, for example, American actress Julia Fox declared her sexual abstinence in response to the overturning of a 1973 US Supreme Court ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion up to the 24th week of pregnancy. In 2022, the same court overturned this ruling and returned jurisdiction over the issue to the country's 50 states. "I felt that if they were going to take away the rights we have over our bodies, that would be my way of taking them back," Fox said in an episode of the Zach Sang Show podcast.</p> <p>But it was after this year's US election, which returned Republican Donald Trump to the White House, that the 4B movement gained momentum. Google searches for the term exploded between the day before and the days after the US election on November 5. Thousands of women shared their experiences of abstinence in videos on TikTok. Many even shaved their hair - a hallmark of the movement.</p> <p>South Korean Mingyeong Lee, who has been part of the movement since it was founded, says she is happy to see 4B's profile grow so quickly. "I've been waiting for this to happen. It took eight years to reach you," she told DW.</p> <p>Mingyeong sees similarities between the struggles for women's rights in the US and South Korea. "Eight years ago, we discovered that our friends, fathers or other men close to us didn't share our perspective on gender issues," she explains.</p> <p>She refers to a femicide that took place in Seoul, the capital of South Korea, in which a man killed a woman in a bar bathroom and claimed he did it because she had ignored him all her life.</p> <p>The murder sparked a new wave of feminist movements in South Korea, led by young women who denounced the problem of misogyny in the country. In 2019, nine out of ten victims of violent crime in the country were women, according to South Korea's attorney general. A report published by the UN this week points out that a woman or girl is murdered every 10 minutes in the world by her partner or a family member.</p> <p>Women attacked for "looking feminist"</p> <p>The movement has seen women building solidarity through resistance, but has also faced a backlash. "Women who wear short hair are labeled as sick, harassed and even physically assaulted because they look like feminists," says Seohee Lee, a South Korean student and 4B activist.</p> <p>Still, Seohee says the movement is not about revenge, but about creating a safe community for women. "Korean women are resisting the threats of patriarchy in a silent but highly effective way."</p> <p>Mingyeong Lee, for example, is 32 and doesn't want children. She was born at a time when abortion of female fetuses was still popular in South Korea, even though the country passed a law in 1988 that forbade doctors from revealing the sex of the child.</p> <p>Even so, South Korea today has the lowest birth rate in the world - a rate that its president, Yoon Suk-Yeol, attributes to feminism. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the nation is among the countries with the greatest gender pay gap. "This is a cruel place for women," explains Mingyeong. "If we give birth to girls, they won't be safe or happy."</p> <p>Trump's policies strengthen the movement</p> <p>Ivans lives in Seattle, Washington, 8,000 kilometers away from Mingyeong and doesn't want to have children either.</p> <p>Like Mingyeong and Seohee, Ivans realized that very few men in her life shared her consideration for women's rights. Her father was one of the men who didn't care. Despite almost losing his wife to a high-risk pregnancy, he voted for Donald Trump.</p> <p>During his first term, Trump appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn abortion rights in the US. The Republican called the decision "a beautiful thing to see" and opponents are betting that the Republican's second term could be even worse for women's rights.</p> <p>The idea of getting pregnant and not having access to a safe abortion terrifies Ivans. "My father says he cares about women's rights. But when it comes to voting, he says there are more important things," she says. "So at this point, when influencers are shouting slogans like 'your body, my rules' all over the internet, the next logical step is something like the 4B movement," she adds.</p> <p>The slogan cited by Ivans was propagated by ultra-right-wing influencer and white supremacist Nick Fuentes shortly after Trump's victory. It provokes outrage, but it's more than just words.</p> <p>According to the US National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, two in ten women in the country have been raped at some point in their lives, and almost half experience sexual violence in addition to rape.</p> <p>With their rights and bodies under attack, women like Ivans are taking inspiration from South Korean feminists and their methods of resistance. "Sex is a language that men understand," she explains. "The 4B movement says: 'Hey, I'm going to take this off until you're listening'. Not as a punishment, but as a way of getting attention."</p> <p>Universal language</p> <p>Activist Seohee Lee is happy that American women are embracing the 4B movement. She wonders if they are experiencing what she felt when South Korea elected Yoon Suk Yeol, whose campaign promised to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family.</p> <p>Seohee is not surprised that women in the US also face resistance for using abstinence to defend abortion rights. "After all, I'm a feminist that men hate and detest," she says.</p>
