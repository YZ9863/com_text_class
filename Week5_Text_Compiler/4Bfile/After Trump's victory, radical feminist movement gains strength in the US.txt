       <p>Following the results of the US election, Washington resident Jada Mevs, 25, has been encouraging women to take action by enrolling in self-defense classes, deleting dating apps, starting to use birth control and investing in vibrators.</p>    <p>In response to Donald Trump's election to a second term as president and the failure of three referendums that would have protected abortion rights in Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota, Mevs and other women are drawing attention to the radical feminist movement 4B.</p>      <p>The movement, which began in South Korea, proposes the rejection of heterosexual relationships, marriage, sex and procreation. Although it's too early to assess the uptake in the US, there are already women online adopting these ideas as a form of self-protection.</p>             <p>"If we can't control what they do in terms of legislation and abortion rights, we need to do something for ourselves," says Mevs.</p>    <p>"Starting by cutting out male influence in our lives and making sure we're taking safety precautions, visiting gynecologists and preparing ourselves in the best way for January and the years that follow."</p>         <p>Mevs published a video explaining why she believes women should adopt this stance. 
She had already been pushing men out of her life for about two years, focusing more on herself. Now, she says her reasons have expanded to protecting her safety and health.</p>    <p>"What really drew me to this movement was taking my body and my interests into my own hands," she says.</p>       <p>The original 4B movement gained momentum in 2019, when women in South Korea began to confront deeply entrenched gender inequalities. The movement intensified during the country's 2021 elections. The four "B" words stand for the rejection of heterosexual marriage, procreation, dating and sex.</p>    <p>According to Katharine Moon, professor of political science at Wellesley College, the main difference between 4B in the US and what exists in South Korea is the centrality of marriage.</p>    <p>"This does not diminish the great challenges that American women face, especially younger women, in relation to reproductive rights," says Moon, whose research covers the US-Korea alliance and East Asian politics. "But for women and men in South Korea, until recently, being recognized as an adult socially required marriage."</p>             <p>In the last 20 years, South Korean women have gained more access to education, surpassing men in university enrollment, which has made single life possible. Not being married, however, can turn a woman into a social outcast, and rejecting marriage has become a radical statement, according to Moon.</p>    <p>Searches for "4B Movement" in the US skyrocketed the day after the election, according to Google Trends. Dozens of videos appeared on TikTok within 48 hours, with users sharing why they do or don't support the movement. With the repeal of Roe v. Wade and Trump's opposition to abortion, there are fears that his administration could implement a federal ban on abortion.</p>    <p>Allied to this, concern is growing about online misogyny, known as the "machosphere", and its strand of "incel" culture - men who call themselves involuntary celibates and belittle women.</p>     <p>Alexa Vargas, 26, a lab technician from Boston, has incorporated the ideas of the 4B movement into her lifestyle. She had already been abstaining from dating and sex for more than two years and, after the election results, decided to join the movement.</p>    <p>"I think now, more than ever, I support the idea of 4B because women are tired of men not caring about our health and safety," she says.</p>             <p>Although she's considering dating again one day, she says it's not a priority. "I think it would take a very special man to make me break this movement," she adds.</p>    <p>Moon says she believes that 4B will not become widely popular in the US because the emphasis on not rewarding men with access to women's bodies is based on an issue - the right to abortion - rather than a lifestyle.</p>    <p>"It's a temporary way of drawing attention to the precarious situation of women, with Trump rising to power," she says. "So it's not really a total commitment to a way of life without men. In South Korea, it's a way of life."</p>    <p>There are concerns that the 4B movement could incite violence from men who disagree with women's right to abstain from the four practices, which is why Mevs is considering boxing lessons. She emphasizes that women's safety has never been guaranteed after a rejection.</p>    <p>"If women doing this affects the whole country, great, that's the message," she says. "If you want this country to function effectively, maybe you should give women their rights back. It's as simple as that."</p>
