No dating men, no sex with men, no heterosexual marriage and no childbirth. These are the four principles of South Korea’s 4B movement, a radical feminist movement that gained popularity in 2019, in response to sexism, hidden camera pornography and intimate partner violence. After Donald Trump’s victory,  have sought out the movement. But it would be a mistake for women in the United States to adopt its principles, which risk alienating those who would be our allies while ensuring little actually changes about our reality.
Some American women are already devising plans to apply  and . TikTok and Instagram reels videos related to the 4B movement gained millions of views this week, and Google searches , most notably in Democratic states.
Trump’s win was devastating for many women. Their rage is understandable, but a 4B-style reaction is not constructive or sustainable. Women shouldn’t reduce their ability to demand policy changes and equal dignity to the ways in which we should or should not have sex or bear children. The 4B philosophy is shortsighted, primarily because it demonizes men, including those who champion equality and reproductive freedom, while constraining the women who participate in it.
Women have tried to use  in Liberia, Kenya, Colombia, the Philippines, Belgium and other countries. Aside from gaining publicity, there is little  to suggest that they successfully persuade people. The activist Leymah Gbowee, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011 for leading a women’s protest movement credited for ending the second Liberian civil war,  that sex strikes “had little or no practical effect.”
Trump’s election should spur American feminists to address gendered grievances in ways that could be more materially effective. In developed countries, women wield significant economic and purchasing power, control a  and make up a substantial portion of the work force. In response to rising gender inequality, women should harness their political and economic power to demand change rather than limit ourselves to our sexual power. We would be best served by rejecting unequal household duties, engaging in a consumer strike or boycotting discriminatory companies.
Women also must take this opportunity to bring men along with us. Changing gender roles is a main reason many young men  economically and socially left behind. Instead of boycotting men, feminists should acknowledge the legitimate ways men have lost ground in education, employment and health and find ways to craft a feminist message that includes them in the project of ensuring equal rights for us all.
