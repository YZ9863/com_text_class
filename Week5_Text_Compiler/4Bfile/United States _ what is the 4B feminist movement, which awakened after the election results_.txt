       <p>After Donald Trump's victory, alerts have been lit in several communities and social groups. One of them is the <strong>progressive young women's movement</strong>, who on <strong>TikTok </strong>and <strong>Instagram </strong>are discussing the 4B feminist movement, originating in South Korea. In it, heterosexual women refuse to marry, have children, date or have sex with men.</p>  <p><strong>These women say they are angry and fed up</strong> after a majority of their male counterparts voted for a candidate they hold responsible for sexual abuse. Another key issue is the appointment of three conservative justices to the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> that led to the overturning of the nation's protection of <strong>abortion rights.</strong></p>    <p class="" data-uri="" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="off"><strong>In response, they say they are renouncing men and are encouraging others to join</strong>.</p>  <h2 id="que-es-el-movimiento-4b" class="" data-editable="text" data-uri="
" data-component-name="subheader" data-article-gutter="true">What is the 4B movement?</h2> <p class="" data-uri="" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="off">The <strong>4B movement</strong> emerged in South Korea in 2016 and its name is an abbreviation of the four Korean words bihon, bichulsan, biyeonae and bisekseu, which translate as <strong>no marriage, no childbirth, no dating and no sex with men</strong>.</p>  <p class="" data-uri="" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="off">It is mostly popular among women in their 20s and arises in response to the stark gender inequality in the country, with an emphasis on collective and community action. It develops in a decentralized way, both on and offline, making it difficult to assess its true size and scope.</p>   <h3 data-uri="" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="off">The case that originated 4B in South Korea.</h3> <p class="" data-uri="" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="off">In 2016, a woman was brutally murdered near a subway station in Seoul and the perpetrator allegedly said he killed her because he felt ignored by women. <strong>The incident sparked a wave of outrage and a national reckoning about how women are treated in the country</strong>, which later expanded to talk about <strong>femicide, revenge porn and digital sex crimes</strong>.</p> <p class="" data-uri="" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="off"><strong>Feminism and the gender divide have been resounding issues in South Korea</strong>. Women earn one-third less than men, according to data from the <strong>Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</strong>, the largest wage gap among <strong>OECD</strong> nations.</p> <p class="" data-uri="" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="off">Women are underrepresented in senior and managerial roles. Although South Korea's 4B movement has largely disappeared from media headlines in recent years, the U.S. election has reignited interest.</p> <h2 id="las-elecciones-en-ee-uu-estan-inspirando-conversaciones-en-torno-al-4b" class="" data-editable="text" data-uri="" data-component-name="subheader" data-article-gutter="true">US debates around 4B in the wake of the election.</h2> <p class="" data-uri="" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">Some women are rediscovering the movement and vowing to join<strong>. </strong><strong> Others who are already married or coupled say they plan to protest in other ways, such as boycotting male-owned businesses or </strong>refusing to do emotional labor for men.</p> <p class="" data-uri="" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="off">In a quote to <strong>CNN</strong>, Alexa Vargas (26), a Bostonian, says she stopped dating men a few years ago<strong> after having unhealthy relationships that involved abuse and assault. </strong>Until this year she realized there was a movement and language that aligned with her actions. While she says "men need a wake-up call," her decision has more to do with her and other women.</p> <p class="" data-uri="" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="off">"I don't know if men are going to change their ways. I don't know how this will play out," she says. <strong>"My goal in life and in this movement is to protect young women and girls." </strong>Women who favor 4B online say the way some men respond end up giving women who choose not to link up with them the reason to do so.</p> <p class="" data-uri="" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="off"></p>  <p class="" data-uri="" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="off"> </p>
