       <p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol surprised the country by declaring "emergency martial law" on Tuesday night. After hours of political tension in the country and a unanimous vote in parliament against it, Yoon has declared that he will lift the order.</p><h2>It's official: Martial Law lifted in South Korea</h2><p>According to data from Yonhap news agency, President Yoon Suk Yeol has announced that he will lift martial law after parliament voted to block it.</p><p>At about 4:25 a.m. local time, less than six hours after announcing the order, Yoon said he will hold a cabinet meeting in a few hours where he will officially lift Martial Law.</p><p>He said he will "accept the demand of the National Assembly," and that the order will be revoked as soon as officials wake up, as it is "very early" Wednesday morning in Korea.</p><p>Similarly, he insisted that the parliament "immediately stop the reckless acts of paralyzing state functions," again citing his stated reason for declaring emergency martial law.</p><p>"I declared emergency martial law at 11 p.m. last night as a decisive act of national resolve against anti-state forces attempting to paralyze the essential functions of the state and disrupt the constitutional order of our liberal democracy. 
However, the National Assembly demanded that martial law be lifted, so I withdrew the military forces that had been deployed to carry out martial law. We will lift martial law as soon as possible and we have called a cabinet meeting immediately, but because it is early in the morning, we do not yet have a quorum, but we will lift martial law as soon as morning comes. However, we call on the National Assembly to immediately stop the senseless act of paralyzing the functioning of the state with repeated impeachments, legislative farming and budget farming. Thank you," he said.</p><p>Moments after the South Korean president made his announcement, South Korean citizens who remained in protest until the wee hours of the morning celebrated the news.</p><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: Yoon says he will lift emergency martial law.
