Since 2019, women in South Korea have been promoting the 4B movement, based on four propositions: no marriage (bihon), no childbirth (bichulsa), no dating (biyeonae) and no sex with men (biseksu). Although at the moment it is a relatively small group in relation to the total population, approximately 50,000 members, according to their own considerations, it is a radical response to the current living conditions.
4B has as its antecedent the 2017 'Escape the corset' campaign, a year in which several women shaved their heads, showed themselves without makeup and in baggy clothes, to protest against exacerbated ideals of feminine beauty. Much of their inspiration came from Cho Nam-joo's novel 'Kim Ji-young, Born in 1982', a plea about the precariousness of the female condition in family, work and society.
Another element that energized the 4B movement was the National Birth Map put online by the Korean government in December 2016, as part of a campaign to increase birth rates, information that women considered assimilated them to cattle, without taking into account the high rates of gender violence (41.5%, higher than the world average of 30%), sexual harassment, the wage gap and widespread machismo.
In these conditions, the members of 4B organize themselves autonomously, in 'safe places without men', among other reasons, because of the widespread use of 'revenge pornography' and hidden cameras that record them in intimate situations; to which is added the desire to escape the aesthetic pressure that is evidenced by the fact that South Korea is one of the countries with the highest expenditure on cosmetics.
Although the current government of that country has taken a stand against 4B, it is worth asking whether it is possible to demand that Korean women -men and women all over the world- continue to reproduce life under the current conditions of vital, economic and environmental insecurity.
