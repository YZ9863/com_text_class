       <p>According to a study by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), messages of hate, misogyny and harassment against women, such as "your body, my choice" and "go back to the kitchen", have increased on social media since Donald Trump's victory in the US elections. "The use of the phrase 'your body, my choice' grew by 4,600% on social network X," reported ISD.</p><p> </p><p>The main driver was Nicholas J. Fuentes, a white nationalist and well-known American podcaster, who shared on X: "Your body, my choice. Forever". The post has been viewed more than 90 million times and replicated by more than 36,000 people. Fuentes' video with the phrase went viral on social media. 
"Guess what? Men have won again. And yes, we control your bodies," adds the podcaster.</p><p> </p><p>Other misogynistic messages have also gone viral on the X social network in recent days. One of them is by Andrew Tate, the American social media influencer, who wrote on the X social network on November 7th: "I saw a woman crossing the street today, but I kept my foot on the gas. Right of way? You don't have any more rights".</p><p> </p><p>In addition, according to ISD, other phrases such as "get back in the kitchen" and "repeal the 19th Amendment" (which gives women the right to vote) increased significantly after Trump's election, which analyzed comments directed at women and the discussion of those same comments on the X, TikTok, Facebook and Reddit platforms.</p><p> </p><p>But many women are still reporting on the networks that they receive comments from men such as "your body, my choice" in their publications or in private messages. However, these phrases have gone beyond the digital universe and countless young people and parents point to cases of harassment and attacks in schools and universities with this quote.</p><p> </p><p>On Facebook, the same phrase was repeated 52,000 times in the 24 hours after Trump's victory was announced. </p><p> </p><p>The phrase "your body, my choice" is an alteration of the slogan "my body, my choice", which is used by women in defense of reproductive rights. However, these same rights are now at risk with the return of the president-elect to the White House, who has a more conservative stance on abortion rights.</p><p> </p><p>Trump supports the repeal of Roe V. Wade. The law was already abolished two years ago by three judges appointed by Trump, thus leaving it up to each state to decide whether to ban abortion. Ten states also voted to decide on possible changes to abortion laws.  But seven of the ten states that voted approved the referendums protecting or strengthening abortion rights.</p><p> </p><p>Trump's election also boosted the 4B movement, a radical feminist movement that was born in South Korea and says no to marriage and heterosexual sexual relations, pregnancy or dating. The movement already existed in the US, but gained strength after the appointment of the new US president.</p><br />
