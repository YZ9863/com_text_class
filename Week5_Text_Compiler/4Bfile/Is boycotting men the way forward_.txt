       <p>Trump has barely announced his victory and the world already looks a much worse place, especially for women. Just look at the way some of his most enthusiastic voters celebrated the news:</p>    <p>"Your body, my choices," said one.</p>    <p>"You have no more rights," roared another.</p>             <p>"Men are back in charge." As if it had ever been any different.</p>  <p>Then there will be people saying: "but these radicals are a minority!". That's true. 
But what a minority says on the internet, a majority said at the ballot box, electing a criminal convicted of sexual assault.</p>         <p>The message was clear: for a handsome majority of American men, sexual assault is not a serious enough crime to disqualify someone from the presidency. For them, there are more important things to consider.</p>    <p>And it's in the wake of this depressing conclusion that another piece of news started popping up here and there and caught my eye.</p>    <p>"After Donald Trump's victory, women's interest in 4B movement grows."</p>    <p>I had never heard of 4B, a feminist movement born in South Korea, which advocates women's independence through a boycott of marriage, motherhood, romantic relationships and sex with men.</p>   <p>It's a radical response to a rigid patriarchal structure that traps women between financial insecurity (according to the OECD, the country ranks among the worst in the world in terms of the gender pay gap) and the role of being beautiful, coy and domestic (any similarity to Brazil is no coincidence).</p>             <p>Even before Trump's most recent victory, the scenario in the United States was already showing signs of moving backwards, with rights being revoked, femicides on the rise and a growing normalization of hate speech on the web. It is therefore tempting to look at the election as the last straw in this cauldron of misogyny.</p>    <p>Trump's victory is indeed a defeat for women. And just as the left (another loser of this and other recent elections around the world) needs to review its strategies, feminism should probably do the same. And that's where alternatives like 4B come into play: having exhausted the possibilities for conversation, is a total break-up a solution?</p>    <p>I can't deny that the question leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. A taste of acceptance of defeat. After all, in a structure run by men, alienating ourselves from them sounds to me like a forced silence, like surrendering the battlefield to the other side.</p>    <p>I have no answers. But I feel that the way forward undoubtedly lies in strengthening each other: buying from women, hiring women, promoting women, voting for women.</p>    <p>But, without fear of potential stoning, I feel obliged to also repeat the phrase they love to say and we hate to hear: "not every man". Not every man is the enemy. There are some allies out there. Nobody told me, I saw them myself. Men who are open to listening, to talking, to offering space on stage, to giving up privileges, to acting for change. There aren't many of them, I know. But they do exist. And as the mother of a two-year-old, I can't give up hope that one day there will be many of them. And I want them fighting with us.</p>
