The immediate aftermath of Donald Trump’s presidential election win is already a bad omen for women and minorities across the nation, who within less than 48 hours have found themselves the subjects of hate campaigns designed to belittle and marginalize them.
“Your body, my choice. Forever,” white supremacist, , and far-right political pundit Nick Fuentes hours before the race had even been called in Trump’s favor.
On X (formerly Twitter), supporters of the “grab ‘em by the pussy” , convicted adulterer, , and proud abortion rights destroyer reveled in their own threats against women, openly celebrating what they described as an onslaught of rape on the horizon.
“Women threatening sex strikes like LMAO as if you have a say,” streamer Jon Miller, who later noted that he had successfully removed a community note from the viral post, allowing him to “profit from it.”
A text campaign—and obvious hate crime—issued a to students of color the , claiming the recipients had been “selected” as “house slaves” and were due to appear at plantations.
One message shared online demanded that its recipient appear at Abingdon Plantation.
“This is mandatory,” the read. “Sincerely, Trump administration.”

Another iteration of the campaign reportedly targeted Black public school students at
South Western High School in Pennsylvania, which the principal described in a   to parents as part of a “nationwide spread of AI generated text messages.”

But not all of the vitriol took place online. Activists celebrating Trump’s win overtook Texas State University at the school’s San Marcos Campus,   signs that read “women are property,” “homo sex is sin,” and lists that designated women and slaves under “types of property.”

Meanwhile, American women in digital spaces spent the hours since Trump’s win musing about joining South Korea’s 4B movement as a counterprotest to the developing infringements on their personal autonomy. The guidelines of the voluntary movement involve saying “no” to dating or marrying men, having sex with them, and giving birth.
