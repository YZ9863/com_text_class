       <p>The re-election of Donald Trump as president of the United States has triggered unexpected interest in the radical feminist movement known as "4B," which originated in South Korea. This movement promotes women giving up dating, sex, marriage and childbearing with men.</p><p>On TikTok, American women disappointed with the election results began sharing videos declaring their intention to join this trend. In just 48 hours, searches for "4B movement" surpassed 500,000 queries on Google, making it one of the most popular topics of the week.</p><p lang="en" dir="ltr">american women it's time to learn from the koreans and adopt the 4b movement <br /><br />as a matter of fact women from all over the world should adopt the 4b movement<br /><br />i'm so serious pic.twitter.com/WxfqxouAn1</p>- coleni (@jungsooyawning) November 6, 2024<h2>How did the 4B movement come about?</h2><p>The 4B movement was born in South Korea in 2018, in the midst of the #MeToo wave. 
According to Meera Choi, a PhD candidate in Sociology at Yale University, 4B is conceived as a protest against sexism, gender discrimination and violence towards women.</p><p>Choi explains that many South Korean women began to question how the government and men were failing them, leading them to "stop rewarding men by not engaging in heterosexual relationships."</p><p>The term "4B" comes from four words beginning with "bi," which means "no" in Korean. Women who follow it reject:</p><ul><li>Bihon: No to heterosexual marriage.</li><li>Bichulsan: No children.</li><li>Biyeonae: No dating.</li><li>Bisekseu: No heterosexual sex.</li></ul>South Korean feminist movement./ Los Angeles Times<h2>The role of gender in the U.S. election.</h2><p>The U.S. presidential election brought the role of gender back to the center of the debate. Although the reproductive rights issue was expected to drive the female vote in favor of Kamala Harris, Trump managed to attract a significant number of women. According to NBC News polls, Harris garnered 53% of the female vote, compared to Trump's 45%.</p><p>Among black women, support for Harris was overwhelming: 91% voted for her. However, among non-college-educated white women, Trump won with 63% of the vote.</p><p>You might also be interested in: Race betrayal?

Trump has varied his stance on a possible national veto of abortion, at times supporting making it an issue decided by the states.</p><p>This outlook has led some women to channel their discontent into activism in their private lives, boycotting relationships with men.</p><p>"It's about not participating in patriarchy as a way of coping with it," Choi says.</p><p>This was exacerbated when figures such as far-right activist Nick Fuentes posted misogynistic messages on X, such as "Your body, my choice," a mockery of the feminist slogan "My body, my choice."</p><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The masks are fully off now pic.twitter.com/ZlAkFr9FO5</p>- Sam G (@ItsSamG) November 6, 2024<h2>A global movement</h2><p>4B, while initially a local phenomenon in South Korea, has gained international popularity, especially among young women who discover the movement through social networks.</p><p>Aleisa Mora, 30, shared a video on TikTok after reading the novel "Kim Jiyoung, Born in 1982" by Cho Nam-Joo, a text that is considered the origin of the movement.</p><p>Mora's video, re-uploaded after the US elections, accumulated more than 5.9 million views, but also provoked hateful reactions from extreme right-wing sectors.</p><p>"We have tried to reason, to talk to them, but it doesn't work. Now that we don't need the men at all, we have decided not to deal with them," Mora commented.</p>  @wtfaleisa <p>Replying to @user9720585462941 its my roman empire</p> ? original sound - wtfaleisa   <h2>Criticism and limitations of the movement</h2><p>Despite its growth, the 4B movement is not without its critics. Choi points out that 4B may exclude women who do not fit its strict definition of feminism, such as trans women, married women or women with children.</p><p>In addition, cultural differences between the U.S. and South Korea, such as racial diversity, could influence how this movement adapts on U.S. soil.</p><h2>An effective strategy?</h2><p>The 4B movement has raised concerns in South Korea, a country facing one of the lowest birth rates in the world, with only 0.78 children per woman in 2022. Although there is no data directly linking 4B to this drop, the low birth rate is now a central issue on the South Korean government's agenda.</p><p>For women like Marykate Cecilia, the impact of 4B is motivation enough to continue promoting the movement.</p><p>"If enough women decide that this is possible, it would be amazing to see real change and show that women matter," she concluded.</p>  @mknotashley <p>#4b </p> ?
