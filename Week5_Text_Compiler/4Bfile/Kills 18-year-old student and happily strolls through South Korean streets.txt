An attack with no apparent explanation
Last Thursday, October 3, South Korean police arrested Park Dae-sung, a 30-year-old man accused of fatally stabbing an 18-year-old female student in the town of Suncheon, South Jeolla. The attack occurred at around 12:44 a.m. when Park, allegedly under the influence of alcohol, assaulted the young woman in a parking lot after following her for approximately 800 meters. The victim was transported to a nearby hospital, but did not survive the injuries.

The assailant, who runs a take-out restaurant, had allegedly been drinking alone on his premises prior to the attack. He subsequently left the establishment with a gun and, after attacking the young woman, fled when another passerby attempted to intervene. According to reports, the victim screamed "save me" before succumbing to her injuries, the eyewitness recounted.

Arrest and disclosure of the assailant's identity
Police arrested Park at around 3 a.m. after he got into an altercation with another pedestrian while wandering the streets drunk. Following his arrest, the Jeonnam Provincial Police Agency decided to release his personal information, citing the brutality of the crime and the public's right to know the identity of those responsible for serious crimes. Park was evaluated by a criminal psychology expert, who described him as a person with antisocial fantasies, and noted that the offender's apparent lack of remorse suggests latent dangerousness.

In an interview, criminal psychology professor Lee Soo-jung called Park's claim that she does not remember the events due to alcohol consumption "inconsistent." According to the specialist, Park's actions, such as following the victim and changing her shoes after the attack, are indicative of conscious and deliberate behavior.

After stabbing the young woman, Park returned to his store, changed his shoes and continued to wander around the area with the weapon hidden in his clothes. He visited several bars and a karaoke parlor, and according to investigations, spent about two hours walking the streets with the weapon. During this time, he entered various premises and finally threw the weapon in a parking lot before getting into an altercation with the owner of a vehicle, which led to his arrest.

Park claimed not to remember his actions due to his drunkenness, although police, through security camera footage, confirmed that he was wandering calmly around the city. It is now being investigated whether the assailant was looking for another possible target after the murder.
Psychology of the crime: No remorse, no clear purpose
Park Dae-seong's behavior has been the subject of analysis by experts, who highlight the coldness with which he acted after the crime. According to Professor Lee, the smile captured by security cameras could be interpreted as a sign of satisfaction after accomplishing his goal. He also pointed out that the choice of a young and less defensive victim evidences a typical pattern of aggressors who seek out vulnerable people, whether women, the elderly or children.

The Jeonnam Police Agency revealed Park's identity, along with his age and photograph, an unprecedented decision in the province for such a case. The release of this information, authorities say, seeks not only justice for the victim and his family, but also to prevent the recurrence of crimes of this nature.
