       <p class="">Donald Trump's victory has not only brought with it an overwhelming stock market frenzy, but has also increased the strength of publications focused on 4B, a movement coming out of South Korea that advocates the absolute renunciation of men by women, who in the face of rising figures of gender-based violence, the blatant wage gap (South Korea's is the largest between men and women in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) and the worrying increase in sexual harassment, have decided to organize themselves autonomously to reject motherhood and seek safe places without men. It should not be forgotten that the Korean government published in December 2016, in the face of low birth rates, an online National Birth Map showing women of reproductive age, fomenting the anger of many, who felt they were being treated like "cattle."</p><p class="">The four bes of the movement reject heterosexual marriage (in Korean, bihon), motherhood (bichulsan), dating men (biyeonae) and heterosexual sex (bisekseu). Donald Trump's election victory - Harris, by the way, won the vote of 54% of women, compared to Trump's 44% - has increased interest in these 4 bes because of the fear of how the president may treat women over the next four years given the lines of his political program and his comments.</p><p class="">"As a woman, my bodily autonomy matters and this is the best way for me to exercise sovereignty over that. 
So I strongly encourage all other single women who still care about advancing women's rights and who continue to fight for our bodily autonomy to do the same. Delete your dating apps," says one TikTok user, adding to the growing number of women advocating sex strikes. Such movements have been a bargaining tool since antiquity, as evidenced by Lysistrata, the play by Aristophanes that tells of a women's strike and was first performed in 411 B.C. It depicts how, faced with the resulting ennui of seeing their husbands go to war and bear children to die in the conflict, they declared a sex strike.</p><p class="">In 2017, faced with the situation the United States found itself in, singer Janelle Monáe already suggested a sex strike, and Julia Fox has been going without sex for more than two years as a form of personal protest against the overturning of Roe v. Wade. "Calling the 4 bes movement a sex strike suggests that the fundamental purpose of the movement is to change male behavior. The 4B coincides with the reasons I practice celibacy. It is a calculated decision resulting from proving that the costs of sexual intercourse outweigh the benefits. It is less about transforming the hearts and minds of the opposite sex and more about ensuring one's own inner peace," writes author and history and gender studies instructor Hugo Schwyzer in his newsletter.</p><p class="">"What must be clear is that these strikes are not against men, because refusing to have sex with someone is not going against them: we don't owe sex to anyone. There are women who for ethical, political, social reasons refuse to have sex with men. And I believe that this is lawful. Does it serve any purpose? We have seen it from Valerie Solanas with her Andy Warhol moment and her SCUM Manifesto to now in South Korea with the 4B movement, which is having a lot of strength in the face of Donald Trump's victory", explains to S Moda Júlia Salander, author of Tu argumentario feminista en datos (Montena, 2024). "I think the underlying approach is to make a wake-up call about how we understand sexuality, especially heterosexual sexuality, in this system. On a communicative level it's very powerful. Feminism that doesn't discomfort is marketing and this movement clearly discomforts. If we are relating sexually in such an unequal way, under these power structures in which we clearly have a systemic problem of sexual violence, it is powerful to call attention and say that until the rules of the game change, we will not continue to play this game and we do not want to sleep with men," she says.</p><p class="">In The complicated success of sex strikes, Erin Tansimore points out that such strikes "contribute to the perpetuation of women's oppression, harmful heteronormativity, the marginalization or elimination of both sex workers and LGTBIQA+ people, and the reduction of women to sex objects and reproductive machines." The author further stresses that these strikes suggest that sex is something only men enjoy, that women are valuable primarily for sex, and that withholding sex serves as punishment, thereby underscoring stereotypes about gender roles and the nature of sexual relationships. "It's like a form of punishment towards them, because for all these centuries, sexuality and sexual pleasure, rather than sexuality, has been held in relation to men. They were the ones who had a high desire and who suddenly needed to have sex. In that sense, sexuality "at the service of" is still maintained, not an empowered sexuality at the service of women. When women go on sex strike, they do it not only to punish them, but also, in a way, to punish themselves," says Noemí Casquet, journalist and writer specializing in sexuality, who believes that these strikes show that society still thinks that female sexuality is at the service of men. "At a social level, within the patriarchal system we live in, we continue to be sexual objects and reproductive objects. We continue playing with our sexuality based on male pleasure and having our reproductive capacity also at the service of men, so we still have a lot of work ahead of us," she says.</p><p class="">Casquet and Salander agree in applauding the way in which this movement pushes women to prioritize something other than romantic love. "On the one hand, it's critical for women to put their desire at the center, but I think the point of this movement is to highlight that right now heterosexual sex has a potential problem: the lack of sex education and the normalization we've made of violence. I think the goal is simply to show that women are sick and tired of sexual violence," says Salander.</p><p class="">"For me it's all about education and social awareness, but there has to be an interest on their part to listen. If they don't take women into account, see them as a conquest ground and minimize their problems, what's the point? Today, I think the solution lies in raising women's awareness and getting them to get rid of their desire to be loved. If they start putting up with less, they will have no choice but to really rethink their own existence. But men think they're doing nothing wrong, they're still stuck in their privilege," says Casquet.</p><p class="">As a final flourish, it doesn't hurt to keep in mind this reflection Halima Jibril makes in Dazed. "I'm not trying to gloss over the power of sexual assault, but the discussion raises a lot of tensions and complications. I don't know what we are supposed to do with men, but I do know that feminist activism that is framed primarily around gender is harmful. It excludes people and focuses primarily on white, cisgender, heterosexual women, rather than the most marginalized in society. And a feminist politics that does not address this is a feminist politics that will fail," she asserts.</p>
