No sex. No dating. No marriage. No children. These are the four pillars - or "B"s - of the initiative South Korean feminists have dubbed the 4B movement.
The "B" in the movement's English name derives from the Korean translations of the four tenets: "bihon" (no marriage to men), "bichulsan" (no childbirth), "biyeonae" (no dating men) and "bisekseu" (no sex with men).
While the social movement has existed in South Korea since around 2017, it surged in popularity in the United States following Donald Trump's win in the 2024 presidential election.
Jordan Pascoe, George A. Miller visiting professor, studies feminist philosophy, breaking down the origins and social implications of the movement.
"I think what's interesting about the 4B movement is that it comes out of a number of strains of things that were going on in South Korea in the 2010s that have since sort of been replicated in the U.S.," Pascoe said.
