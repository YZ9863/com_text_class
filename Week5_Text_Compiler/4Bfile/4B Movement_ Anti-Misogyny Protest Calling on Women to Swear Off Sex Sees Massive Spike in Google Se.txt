American women are discovering the 4B Movement, a fight against   
As dust settles around Trump's victory, disappointed Kamala Harris supporters have started to shift from asking, "What happened?" to "What's next?" One popular answer, according to Google search results, is the 4B movement.
Originally rooted in South Korea's fight against abuse and institutionalized sexism, the 4B Movement is based on abstaining from marriage, dating, sex, and childbearing as a form of protest.
In the U.S., 4B has gained traction among women disillusioned by perceived threats to reproductive rights and equality. Trump appointed three Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v Wade, which led to several states passing abortion bans.
Many 4B adherents see it as a therapeutic means of reclaiming control in a political climate they view as increasingly hostile to women's rights. On social media platforms, the movement has attracted attention and solidarity, with posts emphasizing independence and rejecting male validation.
Google saw a sharp rise in searches for the 4B Movement in the time since the presidential election was called for Trump.
Interest over time in search term "4B Movement"Google Trends
On Reddit, r/4bmovement has seen a surge in membership.

On TikTok, the term pulls up a sea of explainer videos and proud proclamations. One woman posted about breaking up with her boyfriend. "Cat lady era activated," her video description reads.
On #gymtok, a woman captioned her workout video, "Building my dream body that no man will touch for the next 4 years."
The idea is spreading across X as well.
right now is a good time to start a 4B movement. let male loneliness actually become an epidemic since they hate women so much

Reminder that the 4B movement, and the separatist movement in general, isn't just about avoiding men-it's also about supporting and investing in women. Seek out relationships with women, women-owned businesses, women-made media, etc; surround yourself with women and our culture.  

And as is true of any popular online movement, the memes are coming, including this Mariah Carey Christmas / 4B Movement crossover.
It's not surprising that the 4B Movement has increasing appeal on X, the same platform where conservative influencers like Nick Fuentes have been emboldened.
"Your body, my choice. Forever,"  
It's unclear what Trump's return to power will mean for women's rights, and how many women will end up embracing the 4B Movement. But for now, women are finding comfort in the knowledge that swearing off men is one choice that can't be taken away.
