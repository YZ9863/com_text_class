       <p>"My body, my choice", is the main slogan of the 4B movement that has gained relevance after the results of the presidential elections in the United States, which gave Donald Trump as the winner. </p><p>This movement indicates that women reject the traditional roles imposed on them, especially those of wife and mother, so they are not willing to date men, nor sex, nor marriage, nor children. </p><p>It is a phenomenon that began in South Korea more than five years ago, and has recently gained even more momentum in social networks, in fact, searches on the 4B movement increased on Google immediately after the magnate's victory.</p><p>And it is that the victory of the Republican, means for many a "grievance" against women's rights and reproductive freedoms. </p>
<p>Recall that during his campaign, Trump celebrated the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022, a ruling that put an end to abortion rights in almost the entire country. </p><p>Among the purposes of the 4B movement are to combat misogyny, high numbers of gender-based violence, femicides, spy camera pornography and the wage gap.</p><img alt="France International Women&#x27;s Day" src="" width="3048" height="2135" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low"/>Women demonstrate with a poster reading "Down with the patriarchy" as part of the International Women's Day, Wednesday, March 8, 2023 in Bayonne, southwestern France. Feminist activists see the pension reform as unfair to women, especially because they say it would further deepen gender inequalities faced during their career. (AP Photo/Bob Edme) <h2 class="">Why is it called 4B?</h2><p>It happens because all the words start with "Bi", which in Korean means "No": Biyeonae (no dating men), Bisekseu (no sex with men), Bihon (no marriage with men) and Bichulsan (no children). </p><p>A phenomenon that has inspired various feminist demonstrations in other countries, with women seeking to defend their autonomy and freedom. </p><p>According to World Bank estimates, the female population in the United States is slightly higher than the male population. With Trump's triumph, analysts question whether Americans will formally join the movement or whether they will create their own version but with the same purpose. </p>
