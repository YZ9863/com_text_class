       <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">Aristophanes was a visionary with his famous Lysistrata. In this comedy, women, in order to make themselves heard in a world as patriarchal and sexist as that of classical Greece, chose to ally themselves and went on a sex strike. They knew what men's weak point was and, evidently, after a period of abstinence they achieved their goal. </p> <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">Many centuries later, in this first part of the 21st century, South Korean women followed in the wake of the Athenians and Spartans by going not one, but three steps further. 
It is the so-called 4B Movement, born in the wake of #MeToo and which not only rejects sex with men, but also having romantic relationships with them, marriage and having children. That is, four aspects that women in that country are traditionally expected to comply with and to which some young women are openly opposed so as not to see their freedom threatened, hence the number 4 in the name of the feminist proposal. The B stands for the initial of the terms bihon (no to marriage), bichulsan (no to childbirth), biyeonae (no to dating) and bisekseu (no to sex with men).</p>                   <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">This option, which may sound very extremist to us, is bursting with force in the United States these last few days. After Donald Trump's second victory, in social networks (where especially the election campaign took place and now all the consequences of the results are emerging) many women advocate applying the 4B Movement as a reaction to the fear of the businessman's policies against their freedoms, starting with the right to abortion. But not only that. They are also reacting to the misogynist comments that circulate under the protection of the tycoon's return to power. </p> <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">This is the case, for example, of a well-known ultra-right-wing militant, Nick Fuentes, who wrote: "I would just like to take the opportunity to thank men for saving this country from stupid bitches who wanted to destroy the world to keep abortion", and finishes: "Your body, my decision. Forever," giving rise to the hashtag #YourBodyMyChoice, which has become a trending topic.</p>         <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">On the other side we find another viralized post, which proposes: "Ladies, we have to start considering the 4B movement as the women of South Korea and give the United States a severe decrease in the birth rate". </p>         <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">The war is served in networks. And it will hardly end like Lysistrata's, with men and women celebrating peace in bed. First, because Aristophanes wrote a fiction. And, secondly, because there seems to be a new immunity to the violation of women's rights and many are not willing to lose control over their bodies. Radical or prudish?</p>
