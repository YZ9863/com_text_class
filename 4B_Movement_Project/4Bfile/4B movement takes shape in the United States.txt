       <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">Donald Trump's electoral victory gave rise to the manipulation of the feminist slogan "my body, my choice". And a gender war that has been raging in the United States for some time now, especially after the repeal of abortion rights at the national level, has taken hold.</p> <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist, once a guest at the Florida mansion of the now president-elect of the United States, ran a message on X on election night, November 5: "Your body, my choice." This post became a rallying cry, at least in the networks, of many women, who saw in this subversion the proof that masculinity must be fought.</p>               <h3 class="subtitle">In the U.S., the Korean 4B movement, driven by widespread violence against women, is gaining momentum.</h3><p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">"It's time to close your wombs to men. This election proves more than ever that they hate us, let's not give them a reward," wrote one woman online and quickly garnered more than 270,000 likes. 
Another comment garnered with as much haste or more nearly half a million likes by calling for "stop dating men and have sex with them immediately".</p> <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">In recent years, especially among young women, there has already been the exercise of deleting dating apps (their market value has plummeted), celebrities and others have proclaimed their vows of celibacy (or sexual self-sufficiency), Generation X women (born from 1965 to 1981) their disenchantment with heterosexual marriage, the trend called boysober (ending addiction to the opposite sex), which preaches the virtues of taking men out of the center, is growing.</p> <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">All this provoked on TikTok, X, or Instatgram a surge of interest in the 4B movement that emerged in South Korea around 2016, shortly before #MeToo , whose linguistic translation means refusing dating, marriage, sex with men and having children. That was the response to a society in which there is widespread violence against women, with discrimination and inequality that is systemic.</p> <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">The reaction in the United States to look at 4B is due in large part to the "apathy", a term used by Shantel Buggs, professor of Sociology and African American Studies at Florida State University, that the recent election results have elicited.</p>                  <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">If the progressive defeat in 2016 led to the great women's march of January 21, 2017, after the first inauguration, this time a demoralization is detected, the so-called heteropessimism that has an individualized response in the networks and a result more of awareness rather than practical results.</p> <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">"There's a lot of stuff popping up on the internet, but it's still a small percentage of the general population using the networks," Buggs noted. "To the extent that we can take these kinds of discourses that gain attention online as indicative of something happening in society at the same time, there are still a lot of people who don't pay attention to that at all," the professor insisted. It seems clear that virality on the internet does not always equate to influence, even if there are ideas that gain followers.</p> <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">According to Buggs, the women who are most familiar with 4B are young women, so there are certain segments of the population more willing to embrace the movement. "But I don't think you're going to see a big national process, something like a sex strike or a dating strike," she stressed. However, he qualified, "I definitely don't rule out that there will be some generational effects."</p> <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">While there's no guarantee that what people say on the networks is what they're going to do, Buggs imagined that "it's quite likely that they're not going to give up sex with every man, but they're going to try to assess whether that man is a man who can be trusted."</p> <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">That trust proves somewhat complex in the face of a portion of male Trump voters, especially young men, who feel emasculated by gay culture, by the transgender threat-despite the fact that they represent only 1% of the population-and by the advancement of women in power roles. Or as one Vanity Fair report headlined , MAGA (the Trump movement) "has an obsession with the penis."</p> <p data-gtm-element-container="modulo-texto-link" class="paragraph">So it's no wonder that Bugss detects in conversations with her students that "a portion are not interested in dating or having sex.</p>
