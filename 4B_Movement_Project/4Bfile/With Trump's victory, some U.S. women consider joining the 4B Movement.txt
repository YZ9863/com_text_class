       <p>Young women on TikTok and Instagram have begun sharing information about the 4B Movement, which promotes the rejection of heterosexual relationships, marriage and motherhood with men, in the wake of Donald Trump's re-election as president<strong> and the majority of those who voted for him being male.</strong> The result brought back into debate the social expectations towards women and the desire to protect themselves in the face of a culture that some perceive as hostile.</p>  <p>An unusual interest in the South Korean feminist movement known as 4B has emerged on social media in the United States.</p> <p>The 4B movement, whose name is an abbreviation of four Korean terms (bihon, bichulsan, biyeonae and bisekseu, meaning "no marriage," "no motherhood," "no dating" and "no sex with men"), began in South Korea in 2015 as a response to gender inequality. It was prompted in part by incidents of gender-based violence, such as the murder of a woman near Gangnam subway station in Seoul, a<strong> crime that sparked mass protests and opened the debate on femicide</strong> and sexual violence in South Korea.</p> <p>Ju Hui Judy Han, a professor of gender studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, points out that the 4B movement is an extension of other feminist movements that emerged to counter violence and discrimination against women. 
In her view, although 4B is a relatively marginal movement in South Korea, it <strong>reflects the dissatisfaction of many young women with societal expectations</strong> around marriage and motherhood.</p>  <h2>US election as catalyst for 4B movement</h2> <p>Trump's re-election appears to have intensified these concerns among American women. Ashli Pollard, a young woman from St. Louis, explained to CNN that Trump's return to power has led many women to rethink their personal lives. "For her, the 4B movement represents an opportunity to prioritize herself and other women.</p> <p>We have tried to please and secure men, but we still face their hatred," she commented.</p>  <p>Pollard, who discovered the South Korean movement a few years ago, stopped dating men in 2022 and <strong>says this decision has improved her life. </strong>In her case, her motivation is not revenge, but the search for a healthier environment. "Now I see a lot of women thinking about 4B and I want them to know they have options," Pollard adds.</p> <p>Other women, such as Alexa Vargas, 26, relate that they <strong>have</strong> also <strong>opted out of relationships with men after negative experiences</strong>. She says she made this decision after experiencing abuse and feeling emotionally drained by toxic relationships. "I don't know if men will change, but my goal is to protect myself and other women," she explained.</p> <p>The 4B movement has deep roots in the struggle for gender equality in South Korea. Despite being one of the world's most advanced economies, <strong>Korean women face a wage gap of around 34% compared to men</strong>, the highest among OECD countries. In addition, cases of digital sex crimes and harassment are prevalent in the country, reinforcing the sense of discontent among young women.</p> <p>"When there is such widespread violence and structural inequality, many women simply cannot imagine getting married or having children," Han says.</p>  <p>In recent years, the 4B movement has dwindled in South Korea, in<strong>part due to internal debates about the inclusion of queer and trans women</strong>. However, Trump's reelection seems to have renewed interest in this approach to life among women in other parts of the world.</p>  <h2>Can the 4B Movement spread in the U.S.?</h2> <p>Despite the attention it has generated on social media, Ju Hui Judy Han doubts that the 4B movement can have a massive impact in the United States, given the diversity of factors affecting women's lives in this country. She also highlights<strong> that many American women voted for Trump, </strong>reflecting that gender inequality is complex and does not affect everyone in the same way.</p> <p>Abby K., 27, believes that while she doesn't expect all American women to embrace the 4B movement,<strong> the debate around it could create a significant shift in how women perceive their options</strong>. Abby recently broke up with her boyfriend because of his disparaging comments about the sexual abuse allegations against Trump. Since then, she has received hate messages on social media, which she says <strong>only reaffirms her decision not to resume dating men</strong>.</p> <p>For some women, like Hadia Khanani, 24, <strong>the problem goes beyond stopping dating men</strong>. She suggests <strong>that misogyny is deeply rooted in society</strong>, and that changes need to go beyond boycotting men or avoiding marriage. "The conversation about relationships with men needs to be addressed from how we raise and educate them," Khanani says.</p> <p>"What I hope is that women in the U.S. can understand that they are not alone in their struggles for equality and reproductive justice," Han concludes.</p>
