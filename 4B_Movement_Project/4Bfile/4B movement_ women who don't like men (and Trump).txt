       Hostilities between women and men are intensifying. The four "B's" of the movement we discuss allude to the rejection of heterosexual marriage ("bihon in Korean"), having children ("bichulsan"), dating men ("biyeonae") and having sex with men ("bisekseu"). On May 17, 2016, in a subway station in Seoul, a 34-year-old male named Kim Seong-min stabbed to death a woman he did not know at all as revenge because he felt ignored by the female gender. That sordid event spurred 4B, which promotes breaking off all sexual relations with men. Now the strange phenomenon jumps to the United States as a way to isolate itself from those who vote for Donald Trump, who does not commune with progressive positions on abortion.
