Trump's election and student responses

On Nov. 5, 2024, Donald Trump was elected as the 47th president of the United States and will take office in the coming year. The inauguration will be held on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025, which coincides with  Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Many U.S. citizens, especially those who voted for presidential candidate Kamala Harris, were shocked by the overnight results following the voting process. In his last presidential term, Trump's administration implemented policies regarding immigration, taxes, abortion and education. In his previous campaign, he stated his intention to tighten border security.   His return to office leaves Democratic voters-particularly minorities-feeling disheartened and uncertain about what lies ahead for their communities, both at home and abroad. 
The Pace Press interviewed University students about their reaction to Trump's election, which prompted reflections on its impact and what it may mean for America and society as a whole. One interviewee, who wished to remain anonymous, described themselves as "anti-Trump." They said, "His success dealt a heavy blow toward the humanitarian rights movements in America. I feel as though he has emboldened the worst of the right-to-be vocal about their control over marginalized groups. Personally, I feel worried for my fellow trans people seeking healthcare, especially in the wake of Trump's proposed plan to shut down the 'chemical, physical and emotional mutilation of our youth.' I know we are in for a tough four years. No matter who or where you are in the world." The response to Trump's election win reflects concerns about further policies, particularly those targeting transgender individuals seeking healthcare. 
Another interviewee, who also asked to remain anonymous, expressed, "[I'm] Unhappy; I don't think this country is in a good direction at all. They further expressed their disappointment with the "majority of Americans [who] didn't do any research because if they did, they would [know] that Trump was not fit to be President. The cost of living will go up and the amount of human rights stripped from people."  
The first interviewee expressed dissatisfaction about Kamala Harris' loss, saying, "I'm disappointed a lot about not only Trump won, but also that Harris lost. I had [built up a huge] hope that we would finally see a woman president. It would've been a huge confidence boost for women. I'm disappointed in the hate that has spread since Trump had been announced as president-elect." 
Nevertheless, both responders acknowledge some positive sides to the post-election. One stated: "If I were to be at least content with some aspects of the outcome. It would be regret. Some Trump voters [are] already sitting in their regret for their vote. Workers are leaving their Christmas bonuses because of the proposed tariffs, while some Trump voters are upset that their progressive family members have cut contact with them. I do not relish in misfortune, but if this is what it takes for people to learn from the mistakes that we've made, then so be it. Another fairly interesting outcome is the implementation of the 4B movement amongst women and other uterus owners." 4B is a radical feminist movement, started in South Korea between 2017 and 2019, that advocates not dating, marrying, having sex with or having children with men.
The second responder shared, "I'm happy in some states that Democrats had some seats in Congress in some states." 
Following the election, President Trump outlined his policy proposals on immigration and other critical issues affecting the nation. His plans have sparked concerns among citizens, with many advocating for their rights to ensure their voices are heard on these important matters.
