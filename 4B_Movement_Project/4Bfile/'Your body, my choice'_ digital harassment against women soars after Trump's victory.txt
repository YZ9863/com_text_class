       <p>Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election has triggered an alarming rise in digital harassment of women, with phrases such as "your body, my choice" and "get back in the kitchen" proliferating on platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok, according to a report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD). </p><p>This trend is linked to increased aggressiveness by influencers in the "Manosphere," a network of misogynist online communities that celebrate Trump's victory as a rejection of reproductive rights and gender equality.</p><h2>The rise of misogynistic online discourse in the wake of Trump's victory.</h2><p>ISD's analysis notes that content creators in the "manosphere" appear to be using the election results as permission to openly and aggressively disseminate narratives that restrict women's rights.</p><p>In this context, the phrase "your body, my choice" has taken on new life, promoted by far-right figures such as podcaster Nick Fuentes, who has managed to get his message to reach over 80 million views on X.</p><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your body, my choice. 
Forever.</p>- Nicholas J. Fuentes (@NickJFuentes) November 6, 2024<p>Fuentes' post, which skewers the famous feminist slogan "my body, my choice," has increased 4,600% since Nov. 6, while calls to repeal the 19th Amendment, which guaranteed women's voting rights, have also seen an increase of more than 600%.</p><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm not even lying when I say please protect yourselves.

(@vvinta_) November 7, 2024<h2>The impact of hate speech in real life.</h2><p>In addition to the rise in online hate speech, ISD has also documented that harassment against women has begun to carry over into everyday life. In schools and universities, especially, there have been reported cases of children and teenagers repeating the phrase "your body, my choice" in an intimidating manner.</p><p>Girls and their families have shared testimonies about this verbal harassment, which reflects a growing culture of rejection of women's rights in educational spaces.</p><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Middle school kids are getting texts telling them to prepare to be slaves, texts telling them 'your body, my choice', and more.  Not 'somewhere' - HERE, in Minnesota. And all over the country. </p>- janashortal (@janashortal) November 8, 2024<h2>The context of political polarization and the rollback of reproductive rights.</h2><p>In the weeks leading up to the election, the issue of reproductive rights played a key role in the campaign.</p><p>Kamala Harris, vice presidential candidate, focused her message on defending abortion rights, while Donald Trump aligned himself with conservative sectors, relying on the support of figures such as Elon Musk and several podcasts popular among young men.</p><p>The use of online platforms has been crucial to promote misogynist and anti-abortion speeches, which have gained ground with Trump's victory.</p><p>You might also be interested in: 'Stop talking about it': Trump upset by questions about his abortion vote</p><h2>A feminist revolt? Responding to digital harassment</h2><p>In response to the rise of harassment, some women in the United States have begun promoting the "4B" movement, a revolt against men inspired by South Korean feminism. This movement advocates principles such as not having sex, not dating men, not marrying men and not having children, reaching more than 20 million views on social networks such as X.</p><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The 4B movement consists of these four nos:<br /><br />- No sex with men<br />- No giving birth<br />- No dating men<br />- No marriage with men<br /><br />do what you will with that information </p>- misa (@mouthfulofmilky) November 6, 2024<p>You might also be interested in: What is the 4B movement in South Korea?
