       <p>Since Donald Trump's election victory, social networks in the United States are filling up with <strong>videos of young women shaving their hair, an act of protest linked to the 4B movement. </strong>The 4B in the US is an adaptation of a feminist movement originating in South Korea, focused on rejecting traditional structures that women consider oppressive. The "4Bs" correspond to the principles of <strong>no heterosexual marriage (bihon), no motherhood (bichulsan), no romantic dates with men (biyeonae) and no heterosexual sex (bisekseu).</strong> In these videos, they show their anger, make the movement visible and tell how they are going to carry it out. 
On this occasion, by shaving their hair to zero, in what seems to be a <strong>clear intention to stop attracting men.</strong></p>                                                        <h3>Origin of the 4B movement</h3>                                                        <p>The 4B movement Emerged as a response to violence against women in South Korea, following a tragic murder on May 17, 2016, known as the Seocho-dong Public Toilet Case or the Gangnam Station Crime. A 34-year-old man, Kim Seong-min, <strong>fatally stabbed an unknown woman in the bathroom of a karaoke bar.</strong> He later claimed his motive was that he hated women because he felt they ignored and humiliated him. This attack sparked a national debate about misogyny and gender-based violence in South Korea, a country where deaths from gender-based violence are the order of the day. Although authorities determined that Kim suffered from schizophrenia and delusions of persecution, many groups interpreted the murder as an act of hatred towards women.</p>                                                        <p>Now, the movement has gained popularity in the US in a context of increasing political polarization following Donald Trump's recent victory in the presidential election. In the United States, the movement has found an echo among women concerned about possible rollbacks in rights <strong>such as abortion and equality between men and women.</strong> Many have adopted it as a form of protest against a system perceived as patriarchal, using platforms such as TikTok to express messages such as "boycott men" or "become independent." 4B became one of the most searched terms after the election.</p>                                                        <p>The ''threat'' to stop stopping relationships with men is related to the so-called sex strikes, where women's groups try to make conflicts visible and change realities that they consider unfair in women's rights. </p>
