SOUTH KOREA - A fire at an Aricell lithium battery factory left 22 workers dead on Monday, most of them Chinese nationals. Local authorities reported that the fire started with several explosions inside the warehouse containing 35,000 batteries.
The fire broke out at 01:31 GMT and was brought under control in about six hours. Kim Jin-young, a Hwaseong fire department official, reported that the victims probably died due to toxic gas inhalation shortly after the fire got out of control.
Television images showed firefighters working to extinguish the blaze in the damaged building, with parts of the upper level collapsed and fragments scattered by the explosions. Aerial views revealed large clouds of white smoke billowing from the structure and several explosions ripping through the building.
