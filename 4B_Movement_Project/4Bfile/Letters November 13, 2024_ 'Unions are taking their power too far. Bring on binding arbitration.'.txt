Time for a change
The Canadian unions have outlived their usefulness. While collective bargaining makes sense for large entities, the right to strike and hold all of us hostage so that they can force their agenda is wrong. We need a new law that mandates all contracts that are not ratified prior to end of contract, they immediately go to binding arbitration. This would provide an incentive for both sides to come to an agreement as mediation can go either way.
Jim Hope
(Tired of hearing about strikes, eh?)
Where are our politicians?
Watching and reading recent news events that consider precious little decisive action on the port strikes is head-shaking alarming.
We have three major ports in Canada. Two are locked out in labour disputes. Hundreds of millions of dollars in trade is lost every day. For a country deep in debt, dropping per person GDP and a listless dollar. Collective bargaining has replaced common sense for critical industries.
Jerry Wilson
(Common sense is in very short supply these days.)
No respect
Nothing shows more the contempt and the disdain that PM Trudeau has for Canadians by moving the fixed election date from October 20 to October 27, 2025. By moving the election day to October 27 some eighty politicians will meet the eligibility requirements for their pension. PM Trudeau's reasoning is the election day conflicts with the five day Indian festival of Diwali. If this is the case why not move it to Monday, October 6 and save the Canadian taxpayer millions of dollars in retired MP pension obligations. PM Trudeau won't for the simple undisputed fact that Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party have nothing but scorn and a deep loathing of and for Canadians.
Jeffrey Anderson
(That may be giving them too much credit. You really think they care about us that much? We think it's just traditional self-serving policy.)
You go girl!
So North American liberal women say they are, effective immediately, adopting all the principles of the Korean 4B Movement. This means these liberal women are canceling all romance, marriage, sex and childbirth, forever. I hope all these women are sincere and fully follow through with their stated commitment. If these liberal women are successful with their plan, the upside for everyone else is, in the next generation, there won't be anymore liberals! I'm calling on all voters everywhere to stand up and give these liberal women a rousing STANDING OVATION!
Chris Robertson
(Although it seems like political affiliation is genetic, we think you're going to be disappointed to learn it's not.)
