Up to 3,000 pregnant women in Haiti risk losing access to crucial health care, the UN warned Friday, as humanitarian conditions in the capital Port-au-Prince continue to plummet.
Gang violence gripped the long-ravaged Caribbean country last week, prompting warnings from aid groups about shortages of medical facilities and staff.
If the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area remains paralyzed in the coming weeks, nearly 3,000 pregnant women could be denied access to basic health care, and nearly 450 could suffer life-threatening obstetric complications if they do not receive medical assistance," the UN office in Haiti said in a statement Friday.

The Haitian crisis has generated concern from the United States, which has called on Prime Minister Ariel Henry, absent in the country, to carry out "urgent" political reform to avoid further escalation.
Criminal groups, which already control much of Port-au-Prince as well as the roads leading to the rest of the country, have attacked key infrastructure in recent days, including two prisons, allowing most of their 3,800 inmates to escape.
The gangs, along with some ordinary Haitians, are calling for the resignation of Henry, who was due to leave office in February, but instead agreed to a power-sharing deal with the opposition until new elections are held.
Henry was in Kenya when the violence broke out and has since been unable to return to Haiti. He is reportedly stranded in Puerto Rico.

On Thursday, the Haitian government decreed a one-month state of emergency for the western region of the country, which includes the capital, as well as a nighttime curfew until Monday.
In a statement on Friday, the UN also warned that more than 500 survivors of sexual violence could be left without medical care by the end of March if conditions do not improve.
