So North American liberal women say they are, effective immediately, adopting all the principles of the Korean 4B Movement. This means these liberal women are canceling all romance, marriage, sex and childbirth, forever. I hope all these women are sincere and fully follow through with their stated commitment. If these liberal women are successful with their plan, the upside is the next generation won't have anymore liberals! I'm calling on all voters everywhere to stand up and give these liberal women a rousing STANDING OVATION! (Political affiliation isn't genetic, Chris.) !@COPYRIGHT=© 2024 Sun Media Corporation.
