SEOUL "" For some women in the United States, the election on Tuesday was a referendum on women's rights, with reproductive freedoms hanging in the balance. So with Donald Trump "" who has been found liable for sexual abuse and touted his role in overturning Roe v. Wade "" winning the presidency, some women say they are turning to a radical Korean feminist movement that swears off men to reclaim a sense of agency. The 4B movement, a fringe brand of Korean feminism, has caught the attention of young Americans on Instagram and TikTok in recent days, with users espousing the merits of its four "no's" "" no sex, no dating or marriage with men and no having children. On Google, searches related to 4B surged in the hours following the U.S. election results. 
Here's what to know about the movement and how it's capturing interest in the United States. What is the 4B movement, and how did it start? 4B is an amorphous, online feminist movement in South Korea that took root on social media in the mid- to late 2010s, at a time when the country was undergoing a renewed reckoning with violence against women and other gender equality issues. It's called the 4B movement because "B" is a form of shorthand for the word "no" in Korean. "Bi-hone," for example, is shorthand for "no marriage" or "willingly unmarried." In 2016, the murder of a 23-year-old woman in a public bathroom of Seoul's bustling Gangnam Station called attention to women's issues nationally, giving life to a yearslong activist movement centered on women's rights in a largely male-dominated society. The assailant, a 34-year-old man, had reportedly said he committed the murder because women "have always ignored" him. By 2018, the #MeToo movement in the United States had spilled over into South Korea, spurring protests and accusations of sexual misconduct against high-profile men. Around the same time, another digital movement called "Escape the Corset" inspired many young women to cut their hair short, dress androgynously and smash their makeup palettes on social media as a rejection of consumerist culture and the male gaze. Some may consider 4B an offshoot borne out of #MeToo or other feminist movements of that period, according to Sunyoung Park, an associate professor of East Asian languages and cultures and gender and sexuality studies at the University of Southern California. "It comes from the everyday life experience of young women," she said. While to some, 4B's tenets might sound radical, to Michaela Thomas, a 21-year-old artist who lives in Georgia, 4B is simply a way to "show people that actions have consequences." Thomas learned about 4B online a year or so ago, she said, and attributes the recent surge in interest to young men voting for Republican candidates. "Young men expect sex, but they also want us to not be able to have access to abortion. They can't have both," she said, referring to many Republican leaders' antiabortion stance. "Young women don't want to be intimate with men who don't fight for women's rights; it's showing they don't respect us," she added.
