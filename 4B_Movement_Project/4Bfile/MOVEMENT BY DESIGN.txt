Philip Buchanan, a scenic painter, left, and Ian Poppleton, a fabricator, hang an acrylic panel with a photograph transparency on it at the New Tampa Community Center last week. Buchanan and Poppleton work for Echo Artz, a graphic design company out of Kissimmee that specializes in entertainment design. The photographer Matt May, of Matt May Photography, was commissioned by the City of Tampa Public Art Program to photograph local children involved in different forms of dance and theater and skateboarding. May then used the photos to create digital photo transparencies for the windows of the Community Center. The installation consists of 19 digital photographic transparencies mounted in windows throughout the community center, which will primarily serve as a gymnastics and dance center. May photographed the young athletes for the project at public gyms and parks.
