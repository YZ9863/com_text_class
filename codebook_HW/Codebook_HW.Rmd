## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


#### Introduce Project ###

My Research Questions:
RQ1: What percentage of coverage was a) prior to the presidential election; b) during the election period; and c) after the election?
RQ2: What percentage of the coverage portrayed 4B movement in a negative way? And what percentage portrayed it in a positive way?

My Codebook:
RQ1: The cutoff data for presidential election:
a)	prior_election: publication data was before 10-31-2024
b)	during_election: publication data was from 11-1-2024 to 11-30-2024
c)	after_election: publication data was after 12-1-2024.

RQ2: The presence of specific negative or positive words:
a)	negative_frame: Hlead include negative keywords of “hate”, “extreme”, “crazy”, “selfish”, “toxic”, “anti-family”, “anti-men”, “anti-social”, and “against tradition”.
b)	positive_frame: Hlead include positive keywords of “brave”, “independent”, “empowered”, “rational”, “modern”, “free”, “freedom”, “autonomy”, “self-determined”, and “social progress”.

### Import Data, Drop Dupulate Articles, and Clean Date ###
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext) 
library(quanteda)
library(readtext)
library(DT)
library(lubridate)
library(rio)
```



```{r}
getwd()
project <- readxl::read_excel("Results list for__4B movement_.XLSX")

project <- project |> 
  filter(!is.na(Title)) |>  
  distinct(Title, .keep_all = TRUE) 

```


```{r}
project$pub_date <- mdy(project$`Published date`)
```


### Create RQ1 Variable ###

```{r}
project <- project |> 
  mutate(RQ1 = case_when(
    pub_date < ymd("2024-11-01") ~ "prior_election",
    pub_date >= ymd("2024-11-01") & pub_date <= ymd("2024-11-30") ~ "during_election",
    pub_date >= ymd("2024-12-01") ~ "after_election",
    TRUE ~ "unknown"
  ))
```


### Create RQ2 Variable ###


```{r}
project <- project |> 
  mutate(RQ2_positive = case_when(
  str_detect(Hlead, "brave|independent|empowered|rational|modern|free|freedom|autonomy|self[- ]?determined|social progress") ~ 1,
  TRUE ~ 0
  ))

project <- project |> 
  mutate(RQ2_negative = case_when (
  str_detect(Hlead, "hate|extreme|crazy|selfish|toxic|anti[- ]?family|anti[- ]?men|anti[- ]?social|against tradition") ~ 1,
  TRUE ~ 0
  ))
```


### Answer RQ ###

```{r}
table(project$RQ2_negative)
table(project$RQ2_positive)
table(project$RQ1)

nrow(project)
```


```{r}
print(paste0(
  "RQ1: The percentage of coverage published prior to the presidential election was ",  round(prop.table(table(project$RQ1))["prior_election"] * 100, 1), "%; ",  "during the election period was ",  round(prop.table(table(project$RQ1))["during_election"] * 100, 1), "%; ",  "after the election was ",  round(prop.table(table(project$RQ1))["after_election"] * 100, 1), "%."
))

print(paste0(
  "RQ2: The percentage of coverage portrayed 4B movement in a negative way was ",  round(prop.table(table(project$RQ2_negative))[["1"]]*100, 1), "%; ",  "in a positive way was ",  round(prop.table(table(project$RQ2_positive))[["1"]]* 100, 1), "%."
))

```
